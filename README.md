# Spiral


## Description

We’ve designed Spiral to be a solution for artists looking for a social media platform to connect with one another and share their work. Spiral allows artists to create their own profile, post, and share their artwork, and meet other artists. This is a group project for DU Full Stack Coding BootCamp.
